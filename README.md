# A Comparison of MCMC for Big Data

Code which compares various algorithms for MCMC on large datasets. See e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05439v1 or http://lancs.ac.uk/~bakerj1/pdfs/unpublished/bigDataMCMCComparison.pdf for the results.

Note that you will need to change the directories to which things are saved to.
